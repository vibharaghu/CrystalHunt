# CrystalHunt


This is the conclusion of the game I've been working on and my wrap up for this VIP.

The game is called Crystal Hunt and the basis is that you are in a dark forest and you have to collect as many crystals as you can before the timer runs out. The concept is simple but I learned a lot about 3D movement, importing models, UI, sound, and signals.

The player can move wasd and sprint. There is collision when the player comes into contact with a tree or the border of the map. When you pass through a glowing crystal on the ground you will collect that crystal and it will be added to your points at the top of the screen. There is a timer for a minute and once the timer is up the game is over and you can hit enter to retry. There is music playing in the background and a sound effect is played when you collect a crystal.
